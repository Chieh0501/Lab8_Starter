# Lab 8 - Starter

1: Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.
  I would fit the automated tests that includes validation, linting, and testing to occur whenever something is pushed following the CI/CD mindset. This would make managing the code much easier and is better in the scope of user experience while also created a fail-safe for me to revert into if something turned out to be faulty.

2: I do not think I would use and E2E testing for function output as I categorize this as more of an unit testing. I picture E2E testing for more appearance and site-related testing like button functionality. 

3: No, Unit tests are supposed to be fast and isolated, it should only test on features locally and ones that are easily testable.

4: Yes, As this feature is considerably simple and easy to test. This could be quickly executed and would fit nicely into an unit test.
